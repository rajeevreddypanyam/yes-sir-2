# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - YES SIR Mobile

## 1. Introduction
This PRD defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the YES SIR
mobile application. The app serves Android and iOS users with a shared Flutter
codebase and relies on Firebase for identity, data, and automation. Core goals
include secure multi-role access, accurate field attendance tracking, and
productive collaboration between admins, team leads, and employees.

## 2. Goals
- Deliver a delightful, reliable mobile experience for workforce management.
- Provide offline-first workflows that resync seamlessly when connectivity
  returns.
- Enforce strong security and privacy controls across organizations.
- Enable rapid iteration through modular features and Firebase-backed
  configuration.

## 3. Target Audience & Roles
- **Organization Administrators (Org Admins)**: Own company onboarding, policy
  configuration, and escalated approvals. Require full data visibility.
- **Team Administrators (Team Admins)**: Lead specific teams, manage leave,
  respond to exceptions, and support staff while also using employee tools.
- **Employees**: Field workers or office staff who record attendance, complete
  tasks, and interact with AI assistance.

## 4. Role Permissions
### 4.1 Org Admin
- Approve/deny any leave, override attendance, and edit organization policies.
- Manage roles, invite/remove members, reset passwords, and assign teams.
- Configure locations, geofences, shift templates, and system settings.
- Access all analytics, exports, and AI assistant actions.

### 4.2 Team Admin
- Full employee feature set.
- Scoped admin powers for assigned teams only (view/edit members, approve leave,
  respond to attendance overrides, review timelines).
- Read-only access to organization-level settings and policies.

### 4.3 Employee
- Personal access to attendance, tasks, timeline, leave, notifications, and
  profile settings.
- Can submit overrides, leave requests, and interact with the YES SIR assistant.

## 5. Authentication & Onboarding
- Firebase Authentication supports email/password and Google sign-in.
- Org Admins bootstrap organizations through an invite-based flow managed by
  Cloud Functions.
- First-login password change is required for temporary credentials.
- Device verification (App Check) and optional MFA for admins.
- New employees receive email invites with deep links that open the app and
  enforce profile completion.

## 6. Core User Journeys
### 6.1 Employee Daily Flow
1. Unlock device and open YES SIR.
2. See current attendance state, geofence warnings, and assigned tasks.
3. Check in/out with GPS capture and optional photo proof.
4. Review timeline, submit notes, and sync offline data when back online.
5. Chat with YES SIR assistant for policy answers or quick leave requests.

### 6.2 Team Admin Flow
1. Launch dashboard filtered to assigned team.
2. Monitor live check-ins, respond to overrides, and approve leave.
3. Assign urgent tasks, update shift coverage, and communicate with staff.
4. Export team-specific reports from the device or trigger Cloud Function
   automations.

### 6.3 Org Admin Flow
1. Configure organization structure (teams, locations, policies).
2. Review company-wide dashboards, trends, and AI-generated summaries.
3. Invite new admins/employees, manage escalations, and adjust settings.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Initial load < 3s on modern devices, interactions < 200ms.
- **Reliability**: Offline support for attendance, tasks, and leave with
  automatic retry queues.
- **Security**: Firebase security rules enforced per organization; sensitive
  operations validated by Cloud Functions.
- **Scalability**: Tested for organizations with thousands of employees and
  heavy real-time location activity.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant color contrast, voice-over support, large
  touch targets.
- **Observability**: Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics, and custom events for
  attendance/leave workflows.

## 8. Platform Considerations
- Android and iOS builds share feature parity; OS-specific capabilities (e.g.,
  background location permissions) handled with tailored UX.
- Biometric authentication is optional for quick re-entry.
- Push notifications delivered via Firebase Cloud Messaging with role-aware
  payloads.

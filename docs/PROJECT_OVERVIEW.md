# YES SIR Project Overview

## üåç Vision
"YES SIR" is a cross-platform mobile application that empowers organizations to
manage distributed teams through a single, intelligent field-operations hub.
Built with Flutter for Android and iOS, the app blends location-aware attendance
tracking, task execution, and AI-assisted workflows so leaders and employees can
collaborate in real time wherever work happens.

## ‚ú® Core Experiences

### Employee App
- **Unified Sign-In**: Email/password and Google sign-in backed by Firebase
  Authentication with enforced device security policies.
- **Smart Attendance**: GPS check-in/check-out, automatic session tracking, and
  override requests directly from the phone.
- **Geofence Insights**: On-device geofence detection, background reminders, and
  historical movement visualizations.
- **Task Command Center**: Prioritized job list with attachments, proof-of-work
  capture, and offline progress syncing.
- **My Day Timeline**: Map-based view of routes, dwell time, and visit notes for
  compliance reporting.
- **Leave & Holidays**: Submit requests, view approvals, and access shared
  calendars.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Foundation

### Mobile Client
- **Flutter 3** with Material 3 design language and responsive layouts tailored
  for mobile form factors.
- **Provider** state management and modular feature packages for scalability.
- **Platform Channels** prepared for background geofencing, location streaming,
  and push notification handling.

### Firebase Backend
- **Firebase Authentication** for secure identity (email/password, Google, and
  device tokens).
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time multi-tenant data with offline persistence.
- **Cloud Functions** for server-side orchestration (attendance validation,
  report generation, AI assistant bridging).
- **Cloud Storage** for task evidence, route exports, and profile images.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for critical alerts and reminders.
- **App Check & Security Rules** enforcing organization-level isolation and
  least-privilege access.

### Integrations & Intelligence
- **Google Maps Platform** for reverse geocoding, map tiles, and route
  visualizations.
- **OpenAI or Vertex AI** connectors for conversational workflows (proxied via
  Cloud Functions with audit logging).
- **Third-Party HRIS/Payroll** webhooks designed through Cloud Functions for
  downstream synchronization.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy
- CI/CD pipelines deliver signed Android App Bundles and iOS IPAs.
- Firebase App Distribution for internal testing, then Google Play Console and
  Apple App Store releases.
- Remote configuration toggles new functionality without requiring app updates.

## üîí Security & Compliance
- Fine-grained Firebase security rules per organization and role.
- Enforced multi-factor authentication for admins and device integrity checks
  (App Check, SafetyNet/DeviceCheck).
- Auditable logs for admin actions, AI requests, and location overrides.
- GDPR-ready data retention policies with export/delete tooling.

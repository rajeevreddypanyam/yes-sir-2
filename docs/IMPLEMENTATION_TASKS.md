# Implementation Tasks - YES SIR Flutter App

This plan covers the first milestones to deliver a production-ready Flutter
application powered by Firebase.

## 1. Foundations
- **Project Bootstrap**
  - Configure FlutterFire (`firebase_options.dart`) for Android/iOS.
  - Enable Firebase emulators for local development; add environment toggles.
  - Set up CI to run `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and build pipelines.
- **Core Architecture**
  - Implement `AuthController` with Provider, as introduced in this commit.
  - Establish folder structure (`features/`, `services/`, `models/`, `theme/`).
  - Add shared components: loading states, error scaffolds, responsive spacing.

## 2. Authentication & Onboarding
- Email/password and Google sign-in with robust error handling.
- Invitation deep links (Dynamic Links) pre-fill email and organization context.
- First-login password change screen and password strength checks.
- Device registration + App Check tokens stored in user document.

## 3. Employee Experience
- **Attendance Module**
  - Implement check-in/out with background geolocation (geofence & accuracy
    validation via platform channels).
  - Offline queue for attendance events.
  - Daily timeline visualization with map, segments, and export options.
- **Tasks & Jobs**
  - List with filters (priority, due date) and task detail screen.
  - Attachment upload (photos, documents) with progress indicator.
- **Leave & Holidays**
  - Request form, status tracking, calendar integration.
- **Assistant**
  - Chat UI with message persistence and actionable shortcuts (e.g., "Request
    leave tomorrow").

## 4. Admin & Team Lead Features
- **Dashboards**: Real-time stats using Firestore listeners; offline caching.
- **User Management**: Invite members, assign roles/teams, reset passwords.
- **Team Configuration**: Manage shifts, assign geofences, view device health.
- **Approvals**: Flows for leave, attendance overrides, and exception handling.
- **Reports**: Trigger Cloud Functions to generate CSV/PDF and display download
  links within the app.

## 5. Notifications & Automation
- Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging with role-based channels.
- In-app inbox with read/unread state synced to Firestore.
- Background handlers for attendance reminders and urgent alerts.

## 6. Quality & Observability
- Add unit tests for controllers and services (mock Firebase via emulator).
- Widget tests for sign-in, dashboards, and attendance screens.
- Configure Crashlytics, Analytics, and custom logging for critical flows.
- Localization scaffolding (English default, easily extendable).

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Offline maps caching for poor connectivity areas.
- Wear OS / watchOS companion experiences for quick check-ins.
- Advanced analytics dashboards for compliance teams.
